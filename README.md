# Glyn Marsh

I am a software engineer working on [scandium](https://github.com/glyn-marsh/scandium) is a computer emulator based of the 2024 version of [jslinux](http://web.archive.org/web/20240621144452if_/https://bellard.org/jslinux/) by [Fabrice Ballard](https://bellard.org/), meant to run on [Bun](https://bun.sh/), and any help is welcome. I also work on the javascript library [huelength](https://www.npmjs.com/package/huelength), capable of finding the associated RGB color to a wavelength.
I somwtimes will have breaks in my commit history as I get interested in other things.
